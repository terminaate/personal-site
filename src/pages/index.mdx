# `about:`

Hey. I’m a **frontend developer** from **Russia** that sometimes does devops and backend.
Most of the time im using **react**/next/remix for frontend, and express/**nest** for backend.

I like putting things together in a way that feels right, both for the user and the code.

Right now im focused on trying to do **"cool" things**, whether it's just a cool looking website or something helpful,
but im also open for freelance opportunities or informal collaborations.


# `projects:`

On my freetime(which is all the time right now lol) im working on <a target="_blank" href="https://cybermp.org" style="color: yellow">CyberMP</a>.
There's also some other projects, most of them you can find on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/terminaate">github</a> or on [projects](/projects) page
