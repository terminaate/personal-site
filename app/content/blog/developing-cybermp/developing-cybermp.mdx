This is my story of working on `"CyberMP"` Project.

Just to make sure you already
know) - `CyberMP is a major modification of Cyberpunk 2077 that adds a multiplayer platform to the game. `

## **!!! Its important to say that im NOT developing main multiplayer platform, im just making services around that platform**

# Beginning

When I first came to project, there was just me and S1nger. At that time I had an idea of making a website of project and maybe in
future making a launcher for the main platform. S1nger agreed to both ideas, but there's was just a little problem) We didn't have any design.

Firstly I thought to start on launcher (for some reason, really didn't remember that time well), and there was the first choice â€” electron or maybe
something else? I really didn't like electron because its really heavy and slow, + effort you need to put it into production, so after a couple of
hours
I find out this kinda new thing called `tauri`.

But there was another problem, I DONT KNOW RUST XD, although tauri have almost same rust and js api functions, but sometimes i was need to use rust
side
