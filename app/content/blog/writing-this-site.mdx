import { SiReact, SiRemix, SiMdx, SiVite } from 'react-icons/si';
import { TbBrandFramerMotion } from "react-icons/tb";

## v0

The first version of the website was with a lot of effects,
although it was kinda smooth and efficient, it was written
in pure React without any libraries (except for framer-motion ofc).

Because of that, I couldn't implement an optimized blog system.
Blog posts are usually rendered with ssr for better SEO optimization, and I didn't want to render md/mdx files on the
client-side it would
be huge damage to performance.

Also, this version was full of kinda useless animations and features, and it's too been damaging performance as well.

## v0.5

Version 0.5 is the first redesign concept that has unusual navbar animation,
it smoothly positions itself between pages, even if the pages have completely
different layouts.

This is the first version where I implemented a blog system.
While developing this website, I had huge difficulties with animations between pages.

Combining Next (or any other React SSR framework) + framer-motion and big
animations between pages is a terrible idea in production.
In dev mode everything worked fine, because in dev mode SSR hydration works partially.
The only solution to this problem was using Styled components or writing inline styles for every page component.
I didn't like either of these solutions, Because of this, I temporarily abandoned the idea of redesigning the entire
site. [[More about this problem]](https://rick-moore.medium.com/solution-css-styles-are-removed-too-early-on-page-transitions-with-framer-motion-55d40e6652e)
