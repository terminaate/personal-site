## initial version

The first version of website was with a lot of effects, altought it was kinda smooth and efficient, but it was written
in pure React without any libraries, and i wanted to redesign

## first concept

Version 0.5 have unusual navbar animation, it smoothly position itself between pages, even if the pages have completely
different layout.

This is first version is the first version where I implemented blog system. While developing this website I have very
big difficult about animations between pages,

Combining Next(or any other react ssr framework) + framer-motion and big
animations between a pages is very bad idea on production. In dev mode everything worked fine, because in dev mode
ssr hydration works partially.
Only solution to this problem was using Styled components or writing inline styles for every page component, i didn't
like neither of these solutions, Because of this, I temporarily abandoned the idea of redesigning the entire site
