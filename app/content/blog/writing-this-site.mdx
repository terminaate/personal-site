import { SiReact, SiRemix, SiMdx, SiVite } from 'react-icons/si';
import { TbBrandFramerMotion } from "react-icons/tb";

## v0

The first version of the website was with a lot of effects,
although it was kinda smooth and efficient, it was written
in pure React without any libraries, and I wanted to redesign

## v0.5

Version 0.5 is a first redesign concept that has unusual navbar animation,
it smoothly positions itself between pages, even if the pages have completely
different layouts.

This is first version is the first version where I implemented a blog system.
While developing this website, I have very
big difficult about animations between pages.

Combining Next (or any other React ssr framework) + framer-motion and big
animations between a pages is a terrible idea in production.
In dev mode everything worked fine, because in dev mode ssr hydration works partially.
The Only solution to this problem was using Styled components or writing inline styles for every page component.
I didn't
like either of these solutions, Because of this, I temporarily abandoned the idea of redesigning the entire site
